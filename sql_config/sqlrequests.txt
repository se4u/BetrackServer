1. Introduction: In this study we are interested in how online social network usage is related to subjective well-being. This consent form describes what will happen to you during the study; it will also describe any possible benefits, risks, and discomforts. Before making a decision whether to participate or not, please read the following information carefully.

2. What is the purpose of the study?: The purpose of this study is to examine how online social network usage is related to subjective well-being.

3. What procedures does the study involve?: In this study you will be invited to the Social Health Lab for an initial lab session (30-40 minutes) where you will be introduced to the study by a research assistant, asked to complete some questionnaires, and to install and set up a research application on your smartphone with the help of the research assistant.

This application will record information about how long and how often you use your phone in general and how long and how often you use several specific social networking applications (Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Google Hangouts, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Skype) for a study period of 10 days; no content-related information about what you do when using these applications will be recorded. Throughout these 10 days, you will furthermore be asked to complete three 1-minute- long surveys per day directly on your smartphone (survey 1: 9:30am-1:30pm, survey 2: 1:30pm-5:30pm, survey 3: 5:30pm-9pm). In each of these surveys, you will be asked about how you feel and what activities you have engaged in since the previous survey. In the first survey per day, you will furthermore be asked about how well you have slept in the last night.

Additionally, we may offer you to wear a sleep watch during all nine nights of the study. This is a machine that looks like a small watch and will measure your sleep quality by recording your movements throughout the night. This measure is optional, that is, if you get selected (selection depends on availability of sleep watches in the Social Health Lab at the time of your participation), but do not wish to wear a sleep watch, you can still participate in the other parts of the study.

Finally, you will be invited back to the Social Health Lab to complete some final questionnaires and, if applicable, to return the sleep watch. In this session, the research assistant will furthermore explain the study to you and answer any questions that you might have (30-40 minutes).

4. Your participation is voluntary: Your participation is entirely voluntary; it is up to you to decide whether or not to take part in this study. If you wish to participate, you will be asked to install and set up the application. If you do decide to take part in this study, you are free to withdraw at any time and without giving any reasons for your decision. If you do not wish to participate, you do not have to provide any reason for your decision not to participate.

5. What are the possible risks or discomforts?: We do not foresee any risks in participating in this study. Still, please be reminded that you may choose not to answer any questions that you do not wish to answer, and that you are free to withdraw at any time. (If any issues do arise as a result of your participation, please contact Dr. Chen. Her telephone number is listed above.)

6. What are the benefits of participating in this study?: As a result of participating in this research, you will be given the opportunity to learn more about your individual smartphone use. More specifically, upon completion of the study, we will provide you with individual feedback on how much time you spend per day using your smartphone in general and the social media and communication apps listed above.

7. Will I receive any tangible rewards for participating in this study?: If you complete our study through the Human Subject Pool, you will receive 2 course credits for your participation in the main study and 0.5 additional course credits if you are selected and decide to wear the sleep watch throughout the nine nights of the study. If you complete our study through the Paid Subject Pool, you will receive $20 for your participation in the main study. If you are selected and decide to wear the sleep watch throughout the nine nights of the study, you will receive an additional $5.

8. Your responses will be kept strictly confidential: All of the information you provide will be kept strictly confidential. All electronic study data collected via the smartphone app will be encrypted before being sent from your smartphone to a password-protected server and then stored on encrypted and password-protected computers and/or locked laboratory facilities in the Department of Psychology at the University of British Columbia. Access to any identifying information collected during the study will be restricted to Dr. Chen and her research team.

The questionnaires you will complete in the lab are hosted by Qualtrics, a web survey company. Qualtrics is located in the USA and as such subject to U.S. laws, in particular, the US Patriot Act, which allows authorities access to the records of internet service providers. These questionnaires will not ask for personal identifiers or any information that may be used to identify you (e.g., your name, e- mail, and/or phone number). The web survey company servers record incoming IP addresses of the computer that you use to access the survey (i.e., of one of the computers in the Social Health Lab), but no connection is made between your data and the computer&#39s IP address. If you choose to participate in the survey, you understand that your responses to the survey questions will be stored and accessed in the USA. The security and privacy policy for the web survey company can be provided to you by contacting the research team.

All data will be kept for at least five years. In line with current best practices in psychological research, electronic data will be preserved for future use in open science initiatives. Open science initiatives allow for researchers from different universities to share their data upon completion of studies, in an effort to stimulate further use and exploration of existing data sets. Data is uploaded to an online form in the form of a computer software file (e.g., SPSS), and these files are stripped of any information that could identify you (e.g., names) to ensure confidentiality and anonymity.

9. Who do I contact if I have questions about the study?: If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877- 822-8598. If you have general questions about the study, you can call Dr. Frances Chen, the principal investigator of this study. Dr. Frances Chen may be reached at 604-822- 2549.

10. Subject consent to participate: I have read and understood the consent form. I have had the time and opportunity to ask questions and have had satisfactory responses to my questions. I understand that my participation in this study is voluntary and that I am completely free to refuse to participate or to withdraw from this study at any time. To withdraw from this study during the data collection phase, it will be sufficient for me to uninstall the app; if I do so, my data will be deleted by the researchers prior to any analysis. If I choose to withdraw from the study at a later time (i.e., after data collection has been completed), I can ask Dr. Chen, the principal investigator of this study (604-822- 2549), to delete my data; for my data to be identified and deleted, I will need to indicate my personal study ID (a unique, random number that only I know and that I can find in the settings menu of the app). I freely consent to participate in this study. By installing and setting up the application on my personal smartphone, I am indicating that I agree to participate in the study.
